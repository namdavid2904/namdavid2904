Adding GitHub Stats
Here‚Äôs an image of what we‚Äôll add in this section.

GitHub stats section
For heading, add the following code to README.md:


---

### :fire: My Stats :
We‚Äôll add some stats about the user‚Äôs GitHub activity like the number of commits, number of PRs, etc., to this section. There are many open-source projects on GitHub that offer different stats for the GitHub profile. In this tutorial, we‚Äôll see how to use two such open-source projects.

The first open-source project that offers GitHub stats is GitHub Streak Stats. This project provides the following three stats:

total number of contributions by a user
longest streak of contributions for a user
current streak stat for a user
Access the stats using the following URL:

https://github-readme-streak-stats.herokuapp.com/?user=your-github-username
We can add customizations like theme, background color, and so on, by adding query parameters to the above URL. Add the following code to README.md. Replace the github-username with your GitHub username:

[![GitHub Streak](http://github-readme-streak-stats.herokuapp.com?user=your-github-username&theme=dark&background=000000)](https://git.io/streak-stats)
Here‚Äôs a preview with itsZed0 as the username.

Streak stats preview
We can also use the Streak Stats Website to generate the URL. To do so, follow these steps:

Go to the Streak Stats Website. In the Username field, enter your GitHub username. Change the other fields as needed.
Once you‚Äôve customized all the fields, click on the Submit button.
After the Markdown is generated, click on the Copy To Clipboard button and add the copied Markdown to README.md.
Streak Stats Tool
The next open-source project that provides some more GitHub stats of a user is GitHub Readme Stats by Anurag Hazra. This project provides many stats, but for this tutorial, we‚Äôll only use the one which displays the top languages used by the GitHub user. If you want to explore and use more stats from this project, you can go through the detailed documentation available in their repository.

Below is the Markdown to display the top languages of a user:

[![Top Langs](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api/top-langs/?username=your-github-username)](https://github.com/anuraghazra/github-readme-stats)
We can customize it to give a different color, limit the maximum number of languages to show, and so on. For customization details, refer to the GitHub Readme Stats repository.

Add the following code to README.md. Replace the your-github-username with your username:

[![Top Langs](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api/top-langs/?username=your-github-username&layout=compact&theme=vision-friendly-dark)](https://github.com/anuraghazra/github-readme-stats)
Pictured below is the preview for my itsZed0 account.

Adding Recent Blogs to Your GitHub Profile README
The picture below shows what we‚Äôre aiming for in this section.

Blog posts
For the heading, add the following code to your GitHub profile README.md:

---

### :writing_hand: Blog Posts :
This section will show the recent blog posts published by a GitHub user at different blogging platforms. To achieve this, we‚Äôll create a GitHub workflow, which is an automated process to execute jobs. Each job in a workflow will have one or more actions. A GitHub action is a set of executable commands combined into steps. We can either create our own GitHub action or use an action created by some other user.

To fetch the blog posts, we‚Äôll use two already existing actions:

Checkout: used to check out all the files in the current repository to a Git workspace where our workflow can access it.
Blog Post Workflow: used to fetch recent blog posts published by a user on various websites.
The workflow can be run on a specific schedule or an event trigger. For this tutorial, we‚Äôll execute the workflow every one hour, to fetch the recent blog post. You can read more about GitHub actions from the official documentation.

To configure the GitHub workflow, follow these steps:

Add the following code to your README.md. The workflow will replace the comment below with the list of published blog posts:
<!-- BLOG-POST-LIST:START -->
<!-- BLOG-POST-LIST:END -->
Save the changes by clicking on the Commit changes button.
The configuration of GitHub workflow is defined in a .yml file, which follows a YAML syntax. In your repository, in the Add File dropdown, select Create New file.
Create new file in GitHub
In Name your file.. field, enter .github/workflows/blog-post-workflow.yml. All GitHub workflow‚Äôs .yml configuration files reside under the .github/workflows directory.
Create blog post yml file
Add the following code in the Edit new file tab:
name: Latest blog post workflow
on:
  schedule:
    # Runs every hour
    - cron: '0 * * * *'
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  update-readme-with-blog:
    name: Update this repos README with latest blog posts
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - uses: gautamkrishnar/blog-post-workflow@master
        with:
          max_post_count: "4"
          feed_list: "https://dev.to/feed/itszed0"
In the above code, we‚Äôve defined a workflow with name as ‚ÄúLatest blog post workflow‚Äù, which runs on a schedule mentioned in the cron field. 0 * * * * is a POSIX cron syntax, meaning that the schedule is to run at the 0th minute every hour.

workflow_dispatch: allows the user to trigger the workflow manually. jobs let us define one or more jobs that will run when the workflow is executed. In our case, we have one job ‚Äî that is, update-readme-with-blog ‚Äî which runs-on an Ubuntu environment machine hosted by GitHub.

steps define a set of actions or commands to be executed. We‚Äôve defined two actions under steps: actions/checkout@v2 and gautamkrishnar/blog-post-workflow@master. The latter takes two input parameters defined under the with field. max_post_count defines the maximum number of posts to show in the README, feed_list is a comma-separated RSS feed of URLs for different blogging platforms.

In this tutorial, we‚Äôve fetched blogs from the dev.to platform. For the list of all supported platforms, check this documentation.

To learn more about GitHub workflow syntax, check out this Workflow Syntax documentation.

Replace the feed_list with your RSS feed URLs and click on the Commit new file button. This will successfully create the workflow. It will fetch new blog posts from dev.to and add them to your README.md file every hour.

To trigger the workflow manually, follow these steps:

In your repository, go to the Actions tab.
Under All workflows, click on Latest blog post workflow.
In the Run workflow dropdown, click on the Run workflow button. The workflow will start executing.
Run Blog post workflow
Go to your GitHub profile page, and under the ‚ÄúBlog Posts‚Äù section you‚Äôll see a list of all the blog posts from the blogging platforms defined in the blog-post-workflow.yml file. Below is the output for "https://dev.to/feed/itszed0" in the feed_list.
Blog posts
Note that the user itsZed0 has one article titled ‚ÄúTest Post‚Äù at dev.to, which can be found here. Hence, the workflow fetches that one article and displays it in the GitHub profile README.

The final GitHub profile is pictured below.

FAQs About GitHub Readme
What is a GitHub README?
A GitHub README is a fundamental document in a software project hosted on GitHub, typically named ‚ÄúREADME.md‚Äù using Markdown formatting. Serving as the front page of a repository, it offers a concise yet informative introduction to the project. The README‚Äôs primary purpose is to provide an overview of the project‚Äôs purpose, features, and usage. It often includes installation instructions, usage examples, and links to more comprehensive documentation.
Moreover, the README may contain guidelines for contributing to the project, specifying how users can report issues, propose changes, or adhere to coding conventions. It also mentions the project‚Äôs license, outlining how others can use and contribute to the code. Visual elements like badges may be added to display essential information such as build status, code coverage, or version numbers. In essence, a well-crafted README is instrumental in facilitating project understanding, user adoption, and collaboration within the GitHub community.

How to customize a GitHub profile?
Customizing your GitHub profile is a great way to personalize your presence on the platform and highlight your work and interests. To get started, create or update a repository with the same name as your GitHub username. Within this repository, add a README.md file where you can provide information about yourself, your projects, and other details you want to showcase. You can use Markdown formatting to style your content, including text, images, links, and more.
After customizing your README.md, commit your changes to the repository. Then, navigate to your repository‚Äôs settings, specifically the ‚ÄúGitHub Pages‚Äù section. Here, set the branch containing your README.md as the source, and save your settings. Your customized profile will now display your README.md content, allowing you to share your story and projects with the GitHub community. If desired, you can further personalize your profile by pinning repositories that you want to feature prominently.
Remember that your GitHub profile is visible to the public, so make sure your customization represents you and your work effectively. This customization not only adds a personal touch to your GitHub presence but also serves as a valuable portfolio for potential collaborators and employers.

How to add GitHub stats to README?
To add GitHub stats to your README, you can utilize third-party services like GitHub Readme Stats or shields.io. With GitHub Readme Stats, you can easily embed dynamic GitHub statistics directly into your README. Start by visiting the GitHub Readme Stats repository, copying the provided code snippet, and pasting it into your README.md file. Customize the code with your GitHub username and preferred options, then commit the changes. When someone views your README on GitHub, it will automatically fetch and display your GitHub statistics, enhancing your profile‚Äôs visibility.
Another option is to use shields.io, a versatile badge generator service. You can access shields.io and select the GitHub category to create badges showcasing various GitHub statistics, such as followers, stars, or your latest commit. After configuring your badge, shields.io will generate a URL that you can embed in your README. Simply insert an image tag with the generated URL in your README.md, and the badge will appear, offering a quick snapshot of your GitHub activity.

How to make a good GitHub profile README?
To create an impactful GitHub profile README, focus on a concise yet engaging presentation of your skills and projects. Begin with a brief introduction, including your name, role, and a touch of personalization to make it relatable. Use a professional photo to humanize your profile.
Next, showcase your work by organizing sections with project thumbnails, titles, descriptions, and links to your repositories or deployed applications. Consider incorporating GitHub Readme Stats or widgets to display your GitHub activity, lending credibility to your contributions. List your skills and technologies to give viewers insight into your expertise. Highlight significant achievements and contributions, and provide contact information for networking and collaboration opportunities.
Customize the appearance with Markdown or HTML for formatting and maintain a consistent theme. Keep your README updated as you embark on new projects or attain milestones, and encourage engagement from visitors by including a call to action. Don‚Äôt hesitate to infuse creativity through GIFs, emojis, or unique design elements. Lastly, review and proofread your README for clarity and accuracy, aiming to create a lasting and positive impression for those who explore your GitHub profile.
